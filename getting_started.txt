STEP 5

Add user level functions to user.h and user.c.  User level functions are
functions that initialize I/O, initialize user peripherals like the ADC,
compute user algorithms, perform calculations on sampled user data, and so on.
User function prototypes and macros may be placed in user.h, and user
functions themselves may go in user.c

STEP 6

Add code to main.c on the line that says <INSERT USER APPLICATION CODE HERE>.
For example, here you would call functions in user.c or system.c, or possibly
setup your own state machine or primary code loop.

Global variables may be added to main.c as well.  As a general practice, macros
and prototypes may go in header files, but variable declarations should not
go in .h files.  Variable declarations should be placed in .c files.

STEP 7

Design the rest of your application.  Add new files to the application, and
test the finished product.

STEP 8

Document what the project does and include other project information in
project_information.txt.
